          I am actively involved in mentoring 3 other IT professionals as they
          navigate various challenges in their careers. I provide them each
          mentoring on various facets of life in technology, from helping them
          redesign their resumes and teaching them Terraform from scratch to win
          over more attractive employers, to helping them realize their worth
          and increasing their salary. With each, we meet on a regular cadence
          to review their goals and track their progress against them, and
          generally chat about industry trends and how to stay ahead of them.
